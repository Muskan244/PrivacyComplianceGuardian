  This file defines the order in which agents are triggered during a data ingestion event.
  The flow is:
    1. watchdog_agent: Detects new data ingestion events and starts the workflow.
    2. data_detective_agent: Analyzes the ingested data for compliance-relevant features.
    3. consent_tracker_agent: Checks and tracks user consent related to the data.
    4. redaction_bot_agent: Applies redaction or anonymization as required.
    5. audit_commander_agent: Audits the process and logs compliance actions.
